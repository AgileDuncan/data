Getting Started
===============

Agile Data implemends an industry-quality data model abstraction layer and universal
persistance layer that is cross-compatible with various database vendors, but if
you are new to all of those complex words, you will find that it's easy to learn
and use Agile Data.

If you follow design principles that are explained in :ref:`design` section, your
code will have low maintenance costs, it will be easy to understand and you will
not sacrifice performance of your code either.

To summarize - continue reading this section for practical excercises, but before
you actually start using Agile Data - read the theory in :ref:`design`
